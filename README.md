# What is this?

Many herb-based remedies have already been lost due to chemical componds being used globally, leading to lost knowledge.

The goal of this app is to provide users with a space to record and look up which herbs have what properties.

Although we're in the very early stages and still thinking things through, here's what I already anticipate to be useful:

## Features

- [ ] Recommend home remedies based on geographical and cultural areas.
- [ ] Suggest medication accordingly with proper location identification.
- [ ] Classify the remedies based on symptoms and illness.
- [ ] Submit remedies for review

    - [ ] We need to flag dangerous ingredients for this to be safe

- [ ] Something to call a doctor?
